# üåê Vacation Tracking System (VTS) - Requirements Documentation

## üìå Domain
The system operates within the domain of **Human Resources** and **organizational management**. It serves employees, managers, and HR personnel by simplifying the vacation request process. The system eliminates the need for individuals to manually understand and interpret company leave policies, and it provides an efficient mechanism for tracking and managing employee leave records.

---

## üéØ Vision
The system will **empower employees** to independently manage their vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off without requiring in-depth knowledge of company policies or facility-specific leave procedures.

## ‚õìÔ∏è System Constraints

1. **Policy Compliance**  
   The system must fully comply with the organization‚Äôs leave and HR policies. Any override actions taken by HR must be properly logged for accountability and audit purposes.

2. **Technical Infrastructure**  
   The system must operate using existing hardware and middleware infrastructure. It must also support integration with external systems, including potential legacy HR and payroll systems.

3. **Data Privacy and Access Control**  
   All system activity logs must be restricted to managerial access only. Unauthorized personnel must not be able to view or modify log data.
